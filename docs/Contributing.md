# Contributing

Third-party contributions are more than welcome! Just make sure to follow these guidelines:

* Make sure that all tests pass by running `make test` (see [Development](https://github.com/codewithemad/num2fa/blob/master/docs/Development.md) docs).
* Add a changelog entry by running `make changelog-entry`. Edit the new file and follow the formatting instructions that it contains.
* Write a good Git commit title and message: explain why you are making this change, what problem you are solving and which solution you adopted. Link to the relevant conversation topics in the forums and describe your use case. We *love* long, verbose descriptions :) As for the title, [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) are preferred. Check the repo history!
